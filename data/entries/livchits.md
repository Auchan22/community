# Hello, I'm Lucas Livchits
## FullStack JavaScript Developer_

I enjoy building things for the web and learning every day. Now, I am in love with development, but I've been a journalist for many years.

I started programming in 2018 with a Python introductory course. Then I was fascinated by the endless possibilities of web development and studied for more than a year to become a JavaScript fullstack developer.

I try to learn more about the subject every day, now I am focusing on React. These are some of the things I have learned so far and that I would like to masterize:

* HTML
* CSS
* TailwindCSS
* JavaScript
* React
* Node
* Express
* SQL
* Git
* Team work
